Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.\n2. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.\n3. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.\n4. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `\"123\" -> 123`, `\"0032\" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).\n5. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.\n6.

Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\n\nThe next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

An example of one system is represented in the following picture:\n\n\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mdir.jpg)\n\n\nHere, we have `dir` as the only directory in the root. `dir` contains two subdirectories, `subdir1` and `subdir2`. `subdir1` contains a file `file1.ext` and subdirectory `subsubdir1`. `subdir2` contains a subdirectory `subsubdir2`, which contains a file `file2.ext`.\n\n\nIn text form, it looks like this (with \u27f6 representing the tab character):\n\n\n\n```\ndir\n\u27f6 subdir1\n\u27f6 \u27f6 file1.ext\n\u27f6 \u27f6 subsubdir1\n\u27f6 subdir2\n\u27f6 \u27f6 subsubdir2\n\u27f6 \u27f6 \u27f6 file2.ext\n\n```\n\nIf we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: `\"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\t\\tfile1.ext\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir2\\n\\t\\t\\tfile2.ext\"`. Note that the `'\\n'` and `'\\t'` are the new-line and tab characters.\n\n\nEvery file and directory has a unique **absolute path** in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by `'/'s`. Using the above example, the **absolute path** to `file2.ext` is `\"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext\"`. Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form `name.extension`, where `name` and `extension` consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.\n\n\nGiven a string `input` representing the file system in the explained format, return *the length of the **longest absolute path** to a **file** in the abstracted file system*.

Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\n\n* `val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.\n* `isLeaf`: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.\n\n\n\n```\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\n```\n\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\n\n1. If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\n2.

The code must be wrapped in a **valid closed tag**. Otherwise, the code is invalid.\n2. A **closed tag** (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : `<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>`.

A **valid** `TAG_CONTENT` may contain other **valid closed tags**, **cdata** and any characters (see note1) **EXCEPT** unmatched `<`, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG\\_NAME. Otherwise, the `TAG_CONTENT` is **invalid**.\n5. A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG\\_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\n6. A `<` is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent `>`.

Thus return true.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\nInput: code = \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\nOutput: true\nOutput:\nWe first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\nstart_tag -> **\"<DIV>\"**\nend_tag -> **\"</DIV>\"**\ntag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\ntext1 -> **\">> ![cdata[]] \"**\ncdata -> **\"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\"**, where the CDATA_CONTENT is **\"<div>]>\"**\ntext2 -> **\"]]>>]\"**\nThe reason why start_tag is NOT **\"<DIV>>>\"** is because of the rule 6.\nThe reason why cdata is NOT **\"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\"** is because of the rule 7.\n\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\nInput: code = \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\nOutput: false\nOutput: Unbalanced.

(Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string `\"/*/\"` does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others.\n\n\n* For example, if the string `\"//\"` occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\n* Similarly, if the string `\"/*\"` occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\n\n\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\n\n\n* For example, `source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\"` will not be a test case.\n\n\nAlso, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so `\"/*\"` outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\n\n\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments.

        "content": "Design a **Skiplist** without using any built-in libraries.\n\n\nA **skiplist** is a data structure that takes `O(log(n))` time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.\n\n\nFor example, we have a Skiplist containing `[30,40,50,60,70,90]` and we want to add `80` and `45` into it. The Skiplist works this way:\n\n\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/27/1506_skiplist.gif)  \n\nArtyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skip_list_add_element-en.gif \"Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\")\n\n\nYou can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than `O(n)`. It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is `O(log(n))` and space complexity is `O(n)`.\n\n\nSee more about Skiplist: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list>\n\n\nImplement the `Skiplist` class:\n\n\n* `Skiplist()` Initializes the object of the skiplist.\n* `bool search(int target)` Returns `true` if the integer `target` exists in the Skiplist or `false` otherwise.\n* `void add(int num)` Inserts the value `num` into the SkipList.\n* `bool erase(int num)` Removes the value `num` from the Skiplist and returns `true`. If `num` does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return `false`. If there exist multiple `num` values, removing any one of them is fine.\n\n\nNote that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n**Input**\n[\"Skiplist\", \"add\", \"add\", \"add\", \"search\", \"add\", \"search\", \"erase\", \"erase\", \"search\"]\n[[], [1], [2], [3], [0], [4], [1], [0], [1], [1]]\n**Output**\n[null, null, null, null, false, null, true, false, true, false]\n\n**Explanation**\nSkiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();\nskiplist.add(1);\nskiplist.add(2);\nskiplist.add(3);\nskiplist.search(0); // return False\nskiplist.add(4);\nskiplist.search(1); // return True\nskiplist.erase(0);  // return False, 0 is not in skiplist.\nskiplist.erase(1);  // return True\nskiplist.search(1); // return False, 1 has already been erased.\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `0 <= num, target <= 2 * 104`\n* At most `5 * 104` calls will be made to `search`, `add`, and `erase`.\n\n\n",

For example, to compress the string\u00a0`\"aabccc\"`\u00a0we replace `\"aa\"`\u00a0by\u00a0`\"a2\"`\u00a0and replace `\"ccc\"`\u00a0by\u00a0`\"c3\"`.

Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.\n\n\nThe kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function `Successor(x, curOrder)`, which given a person `x` and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after `x` in the order of inheritance.\n\n\n\n```\nSuccessor(x, curOrder):\n    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:\n        if x is the king return null\n        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)\n    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder\n\n```\n\nFor example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.\n\n\n1. In the beginning, `curOrder` will be `[\"king\"]`.\n2. Calling `Successor(king, curOrder)` will return Alice, so we append to `curOrder` to get `[\"king\", \"Alice\"]`.\n3.

Calling `Successor(Jack, curOrder)` will return Bob, so we append to `curOrder` to get `[\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\", \"Bob\"]`.\n5. Calling `Successor(Bob, curOrder)` will return `null`.

Count all **trailing** zeros in the product and **remove** them. Let us denote this count as `C`.\n\t* For example, there are `3` trailing zeros in `1000`, and there are `0` trailing zeros in `546`.\n2. Denote the remaining number of digits in the product as `d`. If `d > 10`, then express the product as `<pre>...<suf>` where `<pre>` denotes the **first** `5` digits of the product, and `<suf>` denotes the **last** `5` digits of the product **after** removing all trailing zeros. If `d <= 10`, we keep it unchanged.\n\t* For example, we express `1234567654321` as `12345...54321`, but `1234567` is represented as `1234567`.\n3. Finally, represent the product as a **string** `\"<pre>...<suf>eC\"`.\n\t* For example, `12345678987600000` will be represented as `\"12345...89876e5\"`.\n\n\nReturn *a string denoting the **abbreviated product** of all integers in the **inclusive** range* `[left, right]`.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\nInput: left = 1, right = 4\nOutput: \"24e0\"\nOutput: The product is 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 = 24.\nThere are no trailing zeros, so 24 remains the same. The abbreviation will end with \"e0\".\nSince the number of digits is 2, which is less than 10, we do not have to abbreviate it further.\nThus, the final representation is \"24e0\".\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\nInput: left = 2, right = 11\nOutput: \"399168e2\"\nOutput: The product is 39916800.\nThere are 2 trailing zeros, which we remove to get 399168.
